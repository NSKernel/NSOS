# NS/OS 

NSKernel's operating system - still on the go.

This project is the OS lab at Nanjing University instructed by Dr. Jiang Yanyan. The project is opensourced under GPL v3.

To build the OS, use the Makefile. There is also an option "run" which you can activate by typing "make run" to run NS/OS 0 on QEMU as long as you have one installed.

NS/OS 0 is not finished yet and is still on the go. Now the system gets to it's version 0.1 and has kernel threads, raw memory management, some unit test modules and of course, console which has been there since the last version.

A [wiki](https://github.com/NSKernel/NSOS/wiki) is provided to help you build, use and even hack the NS/OS

NS/OS 0 uses various opensource components. vsprintf.c comes from Linux kernel, iso_font.c comes from .
